# Graphs

Welcome to the Graphs project! This repository contains various algorithms and data structures related to graph theory.

## Introduction

Graphs are a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics. This project aims to provide implementations of common graph algorithms and data structures.

## Features

- Graph representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms)
